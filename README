What
-----

You visit your mplayer box web service in mobile phone's browser, and
you see simple remote control UI. "Button" presses are sent to lircd
which propagates them to various clients including mplayer.


How
----

You'll need to pass --allow-simulate to lircd. Rest is irrelevant
(there's no need to set up any real remotes).
